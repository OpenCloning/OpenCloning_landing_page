</div>

eLabFTW is an Open Source Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) that allows researchers to document their experiments and share them with their colleagues. Through an integration with OpenCloning, eLabFTW users can use OpenCloning to load sequences from their ELN database, plan their cloning, and save the results directly to eLabFTW.
