  - name: "Manuel Lera-Ramírez"
    role: "Lead developer"
    section: "main"
    bio: "During my PhD I used fission yeast genetics to study the mitotic spindle, combining experimental and computational approaches. I grew increasingly interested in FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data in the context of model organism genetics, and decided to join PomBase, the model organism database for fission yeast, where I developed quality control pipelines and worked as a biocurator.
    Now I am working on [OpenCloning](https://opencloning.org), an Open Source web application to plan and document cloning and genetic engineering. I am also an active contributor and maintainer of [pydna](https://github.com/bjornfjohansson/pydna)."

    role: "Collaborator"
    bio: "I focus on metabolic engineering of lipid metabolism in baker’s yeast, _S. cerevisiae_ ultimatily to create sustainable sources of specialized fatty acids. I am also interested in open science, specifically the creation and maintenance of complete and verifiable genetic design documents. I am the original creator of [pydna](https://github.com/bjornfjohansson/pydna), a Python package used by OpenCloning that enables simulation of cloning strategies."

    section: "collaborators"
    role: "Collaborator"
    bio: "I studied experimental evolution in fission yeast during my PhD, gaining interest in computational approaches and reproducibility in science. I started collaborating with OpenCloning as a testing user to later dive in the code and implement new use cases. Currently, I am a non-tenured associate professor in Cell Biology at the University of Bordeaux, with a research intereset in machine learning for transcript classification."
