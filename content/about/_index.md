  - name: "Björn Johansson"
    bio: "I focus on metabolic engineering of lipid metabolism in baker’s yeast, _S. cerevisiae_ ultimatily to create sustainable sources of specialized fatty acids. I am also interested in open science, specifically the creation and maintenance of complete and verifiable genetic design documents. I am the original creator of pydna, a Python package that enables simulation of cloning strategies."

  - name: "Daniel García-Ruano"
    bio: "Daniel García-Ruano studied experimental evolution in fission yeast during his PhD, gaining interest in computational approaches and reproducibility in science. He started collaborating with ShareYourCloning as a testing user to later dive in the code and implement new use cases. Currently, he is a non-tenured associate professor in Cell Biology at the University of Bordeaux, with a research intereset in machine learning for transcript classification."

  - name: "Lucas Levassor"
    bio: "I'm a PhD researcher in synthetic biology at DTU Bioengineering. After doing my BSc at the University of Copenhagen and my MSc from the Technical University of Denmark, with exchange semesters at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, I dove into projects like [teemi](https://github.com/hiyama341/teemi), an open-source literate programming framework for bioengineering. Currently, I'm developing web apps and high-throughput genetic engineering platforms for Streptomyces and Aspergillus. I'm passionate about combining biology and programming to accelerate synthetic biology and automate workflows. Reach out if you are interested in collabs."
